# Travelling Salesman solution through Genetic Algorithm

This project contains an approach for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) through the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm in Python.


## Basic description

The project implements a `World`, that is a collection of `Location`s.
The idea is to find the shortest path from Original City, passing through all the locations, coming back to that same place.


## How to run it
- Python3.6+
- You'll also need Tkinter -- i.e. `sudo apt install python3-tk`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- To run the program with the default settings: `python3 simulation.py`


The problem/GA configs are set on `settings.py`, so you can change it as you wish.
